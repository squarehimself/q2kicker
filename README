First note: You only need the script if you are going to use the
script to help you get started. The script will automagically grab
the patches as it needs them.

Second, you should know ahead of time that this script is merely to assist
in the process of installing the quake2 kicker package, which means
jdolan's aprq2 and Jehar's kicker package that has all of the data.
This is in no way, shape, or form a substitute for intelligence and
awareness of what the script is actually doing. I am by no means
responsible for any damages caused by this, although there shouldn't
be any possibility for an accident to occur.

For anyone who encounters any issues with the script, I will gladly
assist you in completing your quake 2 kickstart. You can find me on
irc.globalgamers.net idling in the channel #tastycast

Jehar can also help you, as he is the other side of the coin here.
So, I say to you, go forth, frag, and prosper.
